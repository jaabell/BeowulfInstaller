#All groups must stay in the order they are.
#guineapig and master names must exist for the cluster installation.
#The compute nodes are the ones used by Slurm to do tasks.
#The storage nodes are the ones used by BeeGFS for storage.
#The master node works as management for both Slurm and BeeGFS, and also as metadata for BeeGFS.
#guineapig must be a compute node and is used to get the system specs for all compute nodes (as they should all be the same).
